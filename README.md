# NMSRA-Security-Guide  
A collection of digital security resources procured by the New Mexico chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA)  

### About  
This collection of resources is designed to guide technology users in their efforts to exercise their human right to privacy and security. Privacy is the right to retain personal information and give it out with consent, whereas security is the right to maintain control over a digital space rightfully obtained and the permissions there in. The objective is to make developing skills and habits enjoyable and effective.  

### Purpose  
In the information age there is an abundance of information being transmitted around the planet. As a result many great accomplishments have been made possible, but so have many violations of human rights been made possible. Made evident by many whistle-blowers and journalists, governments and corporations alike share in these violations of human rights. To a lesser extent, individual actors make aggressions against others' privacy and security rights. This tool is to assist working class and marginalized people in defending their human rights and well-being. Having control of one's data is liberating; furthermore, being in control is emboldening and increases the capacity to practice solidarity.
